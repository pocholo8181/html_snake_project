                    They smell with their tongues.
                    Snakes do have nostrils, but they don’t use them to smell. 
                    Instead they have evolved to smell with their tongue and by using their Jacobson’s organ in the roof of their mouth. 
                    Their smell is quite excellent and has also been described as “smelling in stereo”. 
                    They have a forked tongue and multiple receptors able to pick up different amounts of chemical cues.
