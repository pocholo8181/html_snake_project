                The Western Diamondback Rattlesnake or Texas Diamond-back 
                is a venomous rattlesnake species found in the southwestern United States
                and Mexico. It is likely responsible for the majority of snakebite 
                fatalities in northern Mexico and the greatest number of snakebites 
                in the U.S. No subspecies are currently recognized.
